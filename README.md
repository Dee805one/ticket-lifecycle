To create tickets, users must access the osTicket user portal and log in if prompted. From within the portal, users can submit a ticket request by providing details about their IT-related issues. Each ticket submission involves selecting a relevant Help Topic, writing a brief subject or summary, and including a detailed description of the problemâ€”formatted similarly to an email.

For this lab, two tickets have been created to simulate a range of issues commonly encountered in real-world IT environments. These examples demonstrate how users can effectively communicate problems, allowing agents to triage and respond accordingly.

From the Admin Panel, administrators can view incoming ticket requests as they are submitted by users. Once received, administrators have the ability to assign tickets to individual agents or appropriate teams based on the nature of the issue. Additionally, they can evaluate the severity level of each ticket and apply the corresponding SLA policy to ensure timely resolution.

In this scenario, David reviewed a submitted ticket, assigned it to John, and updated its severity level to a Sev-C, because only 2 people were affected instead of the whole department.

Effective communication is essential when resolving tickets. Clear and consistent updates should be maintained between team members and the affected users to ensure transparency and accountability. As tickets are submitted, they may involve a variety of issues and are assigned accordingly to the appropriate personnel for resolution.

Additionally, thorough documentation is critical for maintaining an efficient and scalable support system. Each ticket should be well-documented to serve as a reference point for future incidents, especially when similar issues arise. This not only supports knowledge sharing but also improves response times and solution accuracy across the team.
