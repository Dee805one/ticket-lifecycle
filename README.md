To create tickets, users must access the osTicket user portal and log in if prompted. From within the portal, users can submit a ticket request by providing details about their IT-related issues. Each ticket submission involves selecting a relevant Help Topic, writing a brief subject or summary, and including a detailed description of the problemâ€”formatted similarly to an email.

For this lab, two tickets have been created to simulate a range of issues commonly encountered in real-world IT environments. These examples demonstrate how users can effectively communicate problems, allowing agents to triage and respond accordingly.

From the Admin Panel, administrators can view incoming ticket requests as they are submitted by users. Once received, administrators have the ability to assign tickets to individual agents or appropriate teams based on the nature of the issue. Additionally, they can evaluate the severity level of each ticket and apply the corresponding SLA policy to ensure timely resolution.

In this scenario, David reviewed a submitted ticket, assigned it to John, and updated its severity level to a Sev-C, because only 2 people were affected instead of the whole department.
